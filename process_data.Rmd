Some results / data is unnecessarily large. In the interest of saving computation time, and 
storage space, it will sometimes make sense to filter out unnecessary data, or process into more 
summarized / compressed forms. This script is to document these types of changes.

# DMCS

Here, dmcs are saved as an excel file. I remove unnecessary columns and save as an RDS file.

these are all DMCs that are significant at bonf < 0.001, and absolute difference beta value > 0.25. See script 2_4_ for more details.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
dmcs <- read_excel(file.path("Z:", "Victor", "Projects", "NIH - cells", 
                             "outs", '2_4_cell_dmcs.xlsx'))
dmcs %>%
  select(Trimester, Celltype, cpg) %>%
  saveRDS(here('data', 'dmcs.rds'))
```
